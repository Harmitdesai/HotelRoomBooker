This project is about simulating Hotel rooms booking with multiple agents.

Here I have used event drive Architecture, in C#.

Hotel class simulates pricing and whenever price goes low, all of the agents get notified and order gets placed.

Also MulticellBuffer class is defined to store incoming order, and lock and semaphores are user for it.

Here are the diagrams.
